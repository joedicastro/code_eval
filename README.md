# Code Eval Solutions

## About Code Eval

[Code Eval](https://www.codeeval.com) is a website to challenge programmers with
programming problems intended to help you to improve your programming skills.


## About this repository

There is my attempt to solve some problems of this project, using the
Python language. The target is to solve as many as I can, and keep the time
consumed by each script below 10 seconds (at that point the script is
interrupted by Code Eval).

### Contents:

There are 3 directories, `easy/`, `moderate/` and `hard/` corresponding with the
level of the challenges in the website. Inside of each hone are two types of
files, the `*.py2` files are the ones with the code and the `*.txt` files are
those which contains the inputs to test the code.

## About Cheating

Don't cheat! If you cheat, you only fool yourself! If you can't do it, you
can not do it, that's all! Almost you tried, and if you keep learning and
studying, maybe one day you can solve those problems that seemed so hard a
few early.

Be proud of what you have achieved instead, even if is little. Especially if
your math and programming skills or education is not so vast (as in my case).
I'm very proud to have solved all of this problems without cheating or copy
another else's solutions. That's the right attitude.

But, once you have a solution, you can learn a lot from the solutions of others.
That's the purpose of this repository too. Maybe you couldn't learn a lot from
my solutions, maybe even you can laugh of the most naive ones, but doesn't
matter, be humble and remember that even the most idiot can teach you always
something. The second purpose is to have a online backup of this code, some
problems were hard to break and I would hate to loose this code.

__The most important thing isn't the Code Eval's rank that you achieve or the
number of problems that you solved, the most important thing is what you have
learned in the process!__
